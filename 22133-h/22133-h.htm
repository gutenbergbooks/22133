Circus, said English people were not an artistic nation, and instead of getting
better, they appeared to be rapidly getting worse. The author of the present
day was losing the sincerity and the individuality which ought to characterise
him.&mdash;<i>Daily Paper.</i>"]</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, gaily did we hasten to the London Institution,</p>
<p class="i2">Expecting some amusement in our inartistic way,</p>
<p>And little did we reckon on the awful retribution</p>
<p class="i2">Which Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Blackburn</span> had in store for us that day.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>We'd fondly looked towards him for an eulogistic blessing,</p>
<p class="i2">But got instead a general and comprehensive curse,</p>
<p>We are, as he informed us, with an emphasis distressing,</p>
<p class="i2">By nature inartistic, and are daily getting worse.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>Thereafter he directed magisterial attention</p>
<p class="i2">Upon the hapless authors who a fleeting fame had got;</p>
<p>He drew no nice distinctions, nor selected some for mention,</p>
<p class="i2">But, with superb simplicity, he just condemned the lot.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>Every man of them is sinning with an ignorance persistent,</p>
<p class="i2">Poet, novelist and critic, or whatever be their sphere,</p>
<p>Their "individuality" is almost non-existent,</p>
<p class="i2">And only on occasions, if at all, are they "sincere."</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>Well, what, then, is the remedy? Will Mr. <span class="sc">Blackburn</span> fix it?</p>
<p class="i2">Must all our fiction travel from the cultured Continent?</p>
<p>Or dares we snap our fingers at this haughty <i>ipse dixit</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">And read our inartistic books in very great content?</p>

<h2>LUSUS NATUR&AElig;.</h2>

<p>In the <i>Field's</i> Dog-for-sale column, there recently appeared,
wedged in between descriptions of vendible Beagles and Bloodhound
Pups, the following remarkable advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>BLOODHOUND, 40-Tonner, for SALE; built by Fife of Fairlie; has all
lead ballast, and very complete inventory.&mdash;For price, which is
moderate, and particulars, apply, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most interesting canine specimen this. The Managers of the
Zoological Gardens should at once apply, if by this time they have
not already done so, and secured the "Forty-tonner Bloodhound,"
with complete inventory, "built by <span class="sc">Fife</span> of Fairlie."</p>

<p>Why, on an Illustrated Paper, should the position of the
reproducer of Artists' black-and-white work be a higher one than

<h2>POLITICS IN PLAY.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I
notice that that eminent
author, Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Arthur
Jones</span>, has written
a play called <i>The Bauble
Shop</i>, in which he has
introduced the room of the
Prime Minister in the House
of Commons as one of his
most striking <i>tableaux</i>. I
have not yet had the advantage
of seeing what I
feel sure must be an admirable
comedy, but in justice
to myself I must ask you
to publish a portion of a
piece of my own, which
seems to me to bear some
resemblance to what I suppose
I must call (as it has
enjoyed priority of production)
the Criterion original.
I call <i>my</i> drama <i>The Walking
Gentleman, or the
Young Premier</i>, and I
beg to submit to you the
last Scene (a very short
one) of the last Act. Here
it is <i>in extenso</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="sc">Scene.</span>&mdash;<span class="sc">Angelina's</span>
<i>Boudoir</i>.
<span class="sc">Angelina</span> <i>discovered
waiting for</i>
<span class="sc">Edwin</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Angelina</i> (<i>anxiously</i>).
And, will he never come!
Ah! that House&mdash;that
House! With its blazing
beacon from the Clock Tower; it&mdash;&mdash;(<i>With
a cry of joy.</i>) Ah, he is here!</p>

<p><i>Edwin</i> (<i>entering hurriedly and taking</i>
<span class="sc">Angelina</span> <i>in his arms</i>). My own one! Yes,
I say it advisedly, my own one! Mine&mdash;Mine&mdash;for
ever!</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Nay, <span class="sc">Edwin</span>; you forget the claims
the Government&mdash;the country&mdash;have upon
your time!</p>

<p><i>Edw.</i> No, darling, I do not. The Division
has been taken; it is all over. At the last
moment I rose in my place in the House, and
made purposely one of the most injudicious
orations ever heard within those respected
walls. I disgusted friends, alienated adherents,
and in every possible manner strengthened
the hands of the Opposition; and,
darling we are beaten&mdash;yes, beaten&mdash;by a
thumping majority.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> (<i>in tears</i>). Oh, <span class="sc">Edwin, Edwin</span>! I
am so sorry!</p>

<p><i>Edw.</i> Nay, do not weep. For thy dear
sake I accepted the sacrifice. I am no longer
leader of the House, I am no longer head of
the Administration, and now I shall have
ample leisure.  Yes, darling, smile once
more. Now I shall have time to be married.
Now I can speak with hope of a honeymoon!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Curtain.</i>)</p>

<p>There, <i>Mr. Punch</i>! If that would not
overwhelm the Stalls and Boxes with painful
emotion, and bring down the Pit and Gallery
with thunders of applause, I am a Dutchman!</p>

<h2>THE MAN FROM BLANKLEY'S.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Story in Scenes.</span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="sc">Scene VI.</span>&mdash;<i>The Dining-room, as before.</i> Lord <span class="sc">Strathsporran</span> <i>is
still endeavouring to grasp the situation</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Don't want to make a fuss, but I suppose
I ought to do <i>something</i>. Good little chap, my host&mdash;didn't like to
tell me I'd made a mistake; but his wife's a downright vixen.
Better make it right with her. (<i>To</i> Mrs. <span class="sc">Tid.</span>). I&mdash;I'm afraid I
ought to have found out long before this what an intruder you must
consider me; but your husband&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> Pray say no
more. Mr. <span class="sc">Tidmarsh</span>
chose to act on his own
responsibility, and of
course <i>I</i> must put up
with the consequences.</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to himself</i>).
It's hard lines to
have to leave <span class="sc">Marjory</span>
like this; but this is
more than I <i>can</i>&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>)
After that, of
course I can only offer to
relieve you of my presence
as soon as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>horrified</i>).
Not for <i>worlds</i>! I can't
have my party broken up
<i>now</i>. I <i>insist</i> on your
staying. I&mdash;I have no
complaint to make of
your conduct&mdash;<i>so far</i>!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Very
kind of you to say so.
(<i>To himself.</i>) Pleasant
woman this! But I
don't care&mdash;I <i>will</i> stay
and see this out; it's
too late to go in to the
<span class="sc">Cartouches</span> now, and I
won't leave <span class="sc">Marjory</span>
till&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>)  Miss
<span class="sc">Seaton</span>&mdash;<span class="sc">Marjory</span>&mdash;I'm
in a most awfully difficult
position&mdash;<i>do</i> let me tell
you about it!</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton</i> (<i>penitently</i>).
Oh, Douglas, I&mdash;I
<i>know</i>&mdash;I heard....
I'm so sorry&mdash;I mean,
I'm so <i>glad</i>! Please
forgive me for treating
you as I did!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> You <i>did</i>
let me have it pretty
straight, didn't you,
<span class="sc">Marjory</span>? But, of
course, you thought me
am impudent cad for
calmly coming in to dinner
uninvited like this&mdash;and
no wonder!</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton</i> (<i>to herself</i>).
He doesn't know
the <i>worst</i>&mdash;and he shan't,
if I can help it! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
It doesn't matter <i>what</i> I
thought&mdash;I&mdash;I don't
think it now. And&mdash;and&mdash;do
tell me all you can
about yourself!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>They converse with recovered
confidence.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> (<i>to himself</i>).
For all the notice
that stuck-up young swell takes of me, I might be a block of
wood! I'll <i>make</i> him listen to me. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Ahem! My Lord,
I've just been telling my niece here the latest scandal in high-life.
I daresay your Lordship has heard of that titled but brainless
young profligate, the Marquis of <span class="sc">Manx</span>?</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> <span class="sc">Manx</span>? Oh, yes&mdash;know him well&mdash;sort of relation
of mine. Never heard a word <i>against</i> him, though!</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> (<i>in confusion</i>). Oh, I&mdash;I beg your Lordship's pardon&mdash;I
wasn't aware. No doubt I got the name wrong.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/076.png"><img width="100%" src="images/076.png" alt="" /></a><h3>"Let me advise you to be very <i>careful</i>."</h3></div>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Ah&mdash;or the facts. Great mistake to repeat these
things&mdash;don't you think? Generally lies.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He resumes his conversation with</i> Miss S.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> (<i>nettled</i>). It's all very well for you to stand up for
your order, my Lord; but it's right I should tell you that the
Country doesn't mean to tolerate that den of thieves and land-grabbers&mdash;I
need hardly say I refer to the House of Lords&mdash;<i>much</i>
longer! We're determined to sweep them from the face of the earth.
I say so, as the&mdash;ah&mdash;mouthpiece of a large and influential majority
of earnest and enlightened Englishmen!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Fancy the mouthpiece has had quite
enough champagne! (<i>Aloud.</i>) My dear Sir, you can begin sweeping
to-morrow, so far as I
am concerned. I'm no
politician.</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> (<i>warming</i>).
No politician! And yet
you sit in the Upper
House as one of our hereditary
legislators, obstructing
the will of the
People! Do you mean
to tell me there's no
incongruity in that!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Consternation among
the company.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> A good
deal, I daresay, if I sat
there&mdash;only I don't&mdash;haven't
had the honour of
being elected at present.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>hastily</i>). He
means he&mdash;he has other
things to do, Uncle&mdash;don't
excite yourself so!
(<i>To Lord S. in a whisper.</i>)
You're only <i>exposing</i>
yourself by talking of
what you know nothing
about. Surely you know
that Peers <i>aren't</i> elected!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> I was
under the impression
they were&mdash;in Scotland;
but it's not worth arguing
about.</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> You're
evading the point, my
Lord. I'm trying to put
plain sense&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>wearily</i>).
I know&mdash;but&mdash;er&mdash;<i>why</i>
try? Wouldn't plain
nonsense be rather more
amusing&mdash;at dinner,
don't you know?</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> (<i>stormily</i>).
Don't think you're going
to ride roughshod over
<i>me</i>, my Lord! If you
think yourself above
your company&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> I assure
you I've no idea what
I've said or done to
offend you, Sir. It was
perfectly unintentional
on my part.</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> (<i>relaxing</i>).
In that case, my Lord,
no further apology is
needed. I&mdash;ah&mdash;accept
the olive-branch!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> By all
means&mdash;if I may trouble
you for the olives.</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> (<i>effusively</i>).
With all the pleasure in life, my Lord. And, without withdrawing
in any sort or kind from any of my general opinions, I think I
express the sentiment of all present when I say how deeply we feel
the honour&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Good Lord&mdash;he's going to make a
speech now! (<i>Little</i> <span class="sc">Gwendolen</span> <i>enters demurely and draws up a
chair between his and her mother's</i>.) Saved, by Jove! Child to the
rescue? (<i>To her.</i>) So you're going to sit next to me, eh? That's
right! Now what shall I get you&mdash;some of those grapes?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span><p><i>Gwen.</i> No, a baby orange with silver paper round it, please.
What is it, Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>?      [<i>She rises and goes to Miss S.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton</i> (<i>whispering</i>). Now, darling, be careful&mdash;you know
what I told you&mdash;you mustn't tell tales or repeat things!</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> Not even if I'm asked, Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>?... No?...
Would <i>you</i> be displeased? Then I won't. (<i>Returning to her seat and
addressing Lord S. confidentially.</i>) Do you know why I've come to
sit next to <i>you</i>? Because I want to see how you behave. You aren't
just like one of our regular dinner-party guests, <i>are</i> you, you know?</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>humbly</i>). I'm afraid not, my dear; but you'll be
kind to me for all that, won't you?</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> (<i>primly</i>). Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> says we should never be unkind to
anybody, <i>whatever</i> their position is. And <i>I</i> think you're rather
nice. I wish Papa would have you to dine with us often, but
perhaps you're expensive?</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>laughing</i>). I don't know, Miss <span class="sc">Gwennie</span>, I've been
feeling uncommonly cheap all the evening!</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> (<i>reflectively</i>). Mamma always says everything's much
cheaper at <span class="sc">Blankley's</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>to</i> Uncle <span class="sc">Gab</span>.). Growing <i>such</i> a big girl, isn't she?
and getting on wonderfully with her lessons. I must get her to recite
one of her little pieces for you, Uncle, dear&mdash;she does it <i>so</i> prettily!</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> Hey, <span class="sc">Gwen</span>&mdash;I'll bet you one of these sugar-biscuits
you don't know who it is you're chatting away so freely to!</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> Oh yes, I <i>do</i>, Uncle; but I'm being very kind to him, so
that he mayn't feel any <i>different</i>, you know!</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> Upon my word&mdash;what will you get into that little
noddle of yours <i>next</i>, I wonder!</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> (<i>after deliberation</i>). Preserved ginger, I <i>think</i>&mdash;I like
ginger better than biscuits. (<i>To</i> Lord S.) You can reach it for me.</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> Come, come, young lady, where are your manners?
<i>That's</i> not the way to speak to that Gentleman. You should say&mdash;"Will
your Lordship be so very kind as to pass the preserved ginger?"</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). Please <i>don't</i>, <span class="sc">Gwennie</span>! I like your
own style much the best!      [<i>He helps her to the preserve.</i></p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> You mustn't allow the child to take liberties, my
Lord. Now, <span class="sc">Gwen</span>, suppose you tell me and his Lordship here
something you've been learning lately&mdash;don't be shy, now!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> Yes, <span class="sc">Gwennie</span>&mdash;tell Uncle a little tale&mdash;repeat something
to him, come, darling!</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> No, I shan't, Mamma!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>She pegs away stolidly at the preserved ginger.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> Hullo? 'Shan't' to your Mother? <i>This</i> how you
bring the child up, <span class="sc">Maria</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> Not when Mother <i>asks</i> you to, <span class="sc">Gwen</span>? And Uncle
wanting to hear it so! No? <i>Why</i> won't you?</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> Because Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> told me not to&mdash;and I won't, either.</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> Hah&mdash;Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> seems the supreme authority here,
evidently&mdash;better get <i>her</i> permission, <span class="sc">Maria</span>!</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton</i> (<i>distressed</i>). Indeed. I&mdash;I never meant&mdash;<span class="sc">Gwennie</span>
didn't understand me quite&mdash;that is all!</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> Oh, Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>! when you said I wasn't to tell tales or
repeat things&mdash;you <i>did</i> say so!</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton.</i> Yes, yes, but that was a different <i>kind</i> of tale
altogether, <span class="sc">Gwennie</span>,&mdash;you <i>may</i> tell a <i>fairy</i> tale!</p>

<p><i>Gwen.</i> (<i>obstinately</i>). If I mayn't tell any kind of story I like, I
shan't tell any at all&mdash;so <i>there</i>!</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> Pretty behaviour, upon my word! Children didn't
behave like that in <i>my</i> young days, <span class="sc">Maria</span>! I should no more have
dared to refuse to tell my elders anything they&mdash;but it strikes me
you leave her too much with her governess&mdash;who, by the bye, has
been going on with his Lordship in a manner that well, really <i>I</i>
shouldn't have thought&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>mortified and angry</i>). I am not at <i>all</i> satisfied with
Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> in <i>many</i> ways, Uncle&mdash;you can safely leave her to me!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>She gives the signal</i>; Lord <span class="sc">Strath.</span> <i>opens the door</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>to</i> Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>, <i>as she passes, last but one</i>). I&mdash;I
suppose I shall get a word with you upstairs?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>overhearing&mdash;to herself</i>). I'll take good care he doesn't!
(<i>To</i> Lord S., <i>waspishly</i>.) Let me advise you to be very <i>careful</i>!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>detaining</i> Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>). I hope you are satisfied with
yourself, Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>? You <i>ought</i> to be, I'm sure&mdash;after encouraging
my own child to disobey me, and behaving as you did
with that most ill-bred and impertinent <i>impostor</i>!</p>

<p><i>Miss S.</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). He is nothing of the sort! Mrs. <span class="sc">Tidmarsh</span>,
you&mdash;you don't understand! <i>Please</i> let me tell you about him!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> I have no desire whatever to hear. I am only sorry I
ever permitted you to dine at all. It will be a lesson to me another
time. And you will be good enough to retire to your own room at
once, and remain there till I send for you!      [<i>She passes on.</i></p>

<h2>"THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA" AT OXFORD.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/077a.png"><img width="100%" src="images/077a.png" alt="" /></a><h3>Teaching him his A. D. C.</h3></div>

<p>The Oxford University Dramatic Society, unlike the Cambridge
A. D. C., is compelled by the Authorities to walk only amidst the
high peaks and sometimes monotonous solitudes of the legitimate
drama. <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, which was chosen for this
term's performance, is, if the truth
must be told, an uninteresting
stage-play. The story is of the
slightest; there is scarcely a
genuinely dramatic incident from
beginning to end. The audience
wearies of a succession of pretty
pictures and sentimental soliloquies
or dialogues, mouths begin
to gape, and the attention wanders.
Is this sacrilege? If it be,
I must be content to be sacrilegious.
But there is scope for
careful and graceful acting, and
of this the O. U. D. S. took full
advantage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Whitaker's</span> <i>Valentine</i> was
a very pleasing performance. He
spoke his lines admirably, grouped
himself (if the Hibernianism be
permissible) excellently, and showed himself in every sense a well-graced
actor. Mr. <span class="sc">Ponsonby's</span> <i>Launce</i>, too, was capital, carefully
thought out and consistently rendered. One or two of the actors in
tights seemed unduly conscious of their hands and knees, but, on the
whole, the acting was of good average excellence. The Ladies here
are real Ladies, not stuffed imitations, as at Cambridge. Mrs. <span class="sc">Sim</span>,
Mrs. <span class="sc">Morris</span>, and Miss <span class="sc">Farmer</span>, were all good. But the one really
brilliant performance was that of <i>Crab</i>, the dog, by a wonderful
Variety performer from the Theatre Royal, Dogs' Home, Battersea.
If this gorgeously ugly, splendidly intelligent, and affectionately versatile
animal is sent back at the conclusion of the run of the piece
to be asphyxiated at Battersea, I shall never believe in the gratitude
or humanity of the O. U. D. S.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:20%;"><a href="images/077b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/077b.png" alt="" /></a><h3>Timothy's Quest.</h3></div>

<p>In the arid life of the book-reviewer there is sometimes found the
oasis of opportunity to recommend to a (comparatively) less suffering
community a book worth reading. My Baronite has by chance
come upon such an one in <i>Timothy's Quest</i>, by <span class="sc">Kate Douglas
Wiggin</span>. The little volume is apparently an importation, having
been printed for the Riverside Press, Cambridge, Mass. It is published
in London by <span class="sc">Gay and Bird</span>, a firm
whose name, though it sounds lively, is as
unfamiliar as the Author's. Probably from
this combination of circumstances, <i>Timothy's
Quest</i> has, as far as my Baronite's quest goes,
escaped the notice of the English Reviewer.
That is his personal loss. The book is an
almost perfect idyl, full of humanity, fragrant
with the smell of flowers, and the
manifold scent of meadows. It tells how
<i>Timothy</i>, waif and stray in the heart of a
great city, escaped from a baby-farm to
whose tender cares he had been committed;
how, in a clothes-basket, mounted on four
wooden wheels, cushioned with a dingy shawl,
he wheeled off another waif and stray, a
prattling infant; and how, accompanied by a mongrel dog named
<i>Rags</i>, the party made its way to a distant village, nestling in the
lap of green hills with a real river running through it. Here boy
and baby&mdash;and <i>Rags</i> too&mdash;find New England friends, whom it is a
privilege for <i>nous autres</i> to know. <i>Samanthy Ann</i> is a real live
person, and so is <i>Jabe Slocum</i>&mdash;a long, loose, knock-kneed, slack-twisted
person, of whom Aunt <i>Hitty Tarbox</i> (whom <span class="sc">George Eliot</span>
might have sketched) remarked he would have been "longer yit if
he hedn't hed so much turned up fur feet." <i>Timothy's Quest</i> is the
best thing of the kind that has reached us from America since
<i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i> crossed the Atlantic.</p>

<h2><i>THE</i> BECKET, NOT <i>A</i> BECKET.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/081a.png"><img width="100%" src="images/081a.png" alt="" /></a><h3>"Bene! Ego sum benedicta!"</h3></div>

<p><i><span class="sc">Becket</span></i> has beaten the record. By the way, how the real original
<span class="sc">Thomas &agrave; Becket</span> would have beaten <i>The Record</i>, if the latter
ecclesiastical
journal had existed
in his time,
and had given
his Grace of Canterbury
some
nasty ones in a
leading article!
But "that is another
story." It
is some time
since <span class="sc">Henry
Irving</span>,&mdash;than
whom no actor
takes more
thought, whether
as to his author's
lines, or to his own
lines when "making
up,"&mdash;has
achieved so great and so genuine a success, and a success that will
last in the memory of playgoers for many years to come, as he has
in placing <span class="sc">Tennyson's</span> <i>Becket</i> on the stage, and himself playing
the part of the great Archbishop. By the side of this ecclesiastic,
his <i>Wolsley</i> is, so to speak, nowhere.</p>

<p>In <span class="sc">Shakspeare's</span> time <i>Becket</i> would have been a difficult subject
to tackle; as indeed did <span class="sc">King Henry</span>
find him,&mdash;an uncommonly difficult
subject to tackle. But fortunately for
English history in dramatic form, it
was left for <span class="sc">Tennyson</span> to treat the
incidents of the story with a free hand,
poetic touch, and a liberal mind. Once,
towards the close of the tragedy,
<span class="sc">Henry Irving</span>, austere, yet pitiful,
going "to meet his King," brought to
my thoughts <i>Savonarola</i>. Grander far
than <i>Savonarola</i> was <i>Thomas Becket</i>,
soldier, priest, and martyr.</p>

<p>Then his tender compassion for the
unfortunate <i>Rosamond</i>, a most difficult
character&mdash;nay, a characterless character&mdash;for
any actress to play! <i>Becket</i>
as archbishop and actor, seems to pity
her for being so colourless. <span class="sc">Tennyson</span>
couldn't do without her, yet he could
do very little with her.</p>

<p>Our <span class="sc">Ellen Terry</span> is a sweet loving
gentle figure, clinging to her royal lover
with a sort of fond hope that one of
these days things in general would turn
out all right; but in the meantime she
is living always "in a maze." The
love-scene (taking place in a marvellously
effective stage set) between her
and <i>Henry</i> is charming. Poor <i>Henry</i>!
With <i>Eleanor</i> the Dark and <i>Rosamond</i>
the Fair,&mdash;whom he was obliged to keep dark,&mdash;the life of the
monarch, like that of the policeman, was "not a happy one."
<i>Eleanor</i> the Queen, as a <i>divorc&eacute;e</i>, was not <i>Henry's</i> wife; but
<i>Rosamond</i>, if, as is supposed, the King had married her, was his
wife and not his mistress. It is just this point that ought to be
emphasised, in order to give the right clue to <i>Eleanor's</i> character
and conduct in regard to her treatment of <i>Rosamond</i>. <i>Rosamond</i>
must be right and virtuous; <i>Eleanor</i> wrong and vicious; the King
fond, weak, and capricious. To regard the whole story as one of a
mere <i>amour</i> is to entirely miss the beauty of the gentle <i>Rosamond's</i>
nature. She is at once "gentle and simple."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:45%;"><a href="images/081b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/081b.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>And herein seems to me to have been the puzzlement in the poet's
mind; he was in doubt whether to regard <i>Henry's</i> attachment to
<i>Rosamond</i> as only a <i>liaison</i>&mdash;to represent <i>Becket</i> as so treating it, or
to place <i>Eleanor</i> manifestly in the wrong, as being herself <i>not</i> the
wife she pretends to be. "Go to a nunnery, go!" is the end of it all.
But at that nunnery, it seems, <i>Fair Rosamond</i> remained for some time
<i>permissu superiorum</i> as, I suppose, a lady-boarder, not assuming the
habit of even a postulant, much less compelled, as a novice, to be
shorn of her hair, and so to appear in the final Transformation Scene
as "The Fair One <i>without</i> the golden locks." This freedom of
action on the part of <i>Rosamond</i> shows what it is to be a postulant in
a convent of a Poetically Licensed Order.</p>

<p>The Scene of the Martyrdom, "Becket's crown," is thrillingly
impressive. The faithful Monks are well played by Messrs. <span class="sc">Haviland</span>
and <span class="sc">Bishop</span>&mdash;a real Bishop on the Stage, among all these
representatives of various sees&mdash;while Mr. <span class="sc">Frank Cooper</span> is a rough-and-ready
<i>Fitzurse</i> leader of the four "King's-men," who, of
course, are all Fellows of King's, Cambridge, and probably, therefore,
under the ancient statutes, Old Etonians. Master <span class="sc">Leo Byrne</span>,
aged eleven or thereabouts, makes quite a big part of little <i>Geoffrey</i>,
whose affections are divided between Ma, Pa, and his nurse <i>Margery</i>
("with a song"), the latter capitally played and sung by Miss <span class="sc">Kate
Phillips</span>.</p>

<p>Where all the scenery is good, it is difficult, perhaps to single out
one set for especial praise; but my advice is, on no account miss the
Second Scene of the Prologue, "on the Battlements of a Castle in
Normandy," painted by <span class="sc">W. Telbin</span>. "Rosamond's Bower," by
<span class="sc">Hawes Craven</span>, is equally perfect in another and of course totally
distinct line. To pronounce upon Professor <span class="sc">Stanford's</span> music when
"the play's the thing" is impossible. The <i>entr'actes</i> deserve such
special attention as they are not likely to command when the
audience is relaxing and refreshing itself.</p>

<p>On the whole, I should be inclined to say that the Lyceum has not
had so big a success since <i>Faust</i>: a success due to the popularity of
the subject represented, and the perfection of its representation. At
least so thinks.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night, February 6.</i>&mdash;"Did you ever
destroy your offspring, <span class="sc">Toby</span>?" Rather curious question to ask any
fellow. To me particularly startling. There are family traditions
that, in accordance with sort of Malthusian doctrine, some of my young
relations, my contemporaries in fact, were put out of the way even
before their innocent eyes had grown accustomed to the light of a
beneficent heaven. Thought at first <span class="sc">George Wyndham</span> meant
something personal; was really thinking of his own woes.</p>

<p>"That's my speech," he
said, showing me with
melancholy smile quite a
bundle of manuscript.
"Worked at it all yesterday,
instead of going to
church. Read every Blue
Book about Uganda; studied
the map, and could
pass an examination in the
matter of its rivers and
valleys, its hills and lakes,
its various tribes, who are
always murdering each
other.  Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>,
you know, asked me to resume
Debate at to-night's
Sitting. Great opportunity;
meant to make most
of it; then, when I'm in
my place conning my manuscript,
Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>
gives me up. Mr. G. reads
text of <span class="sc">Portal's</span> instructions,
and shows we've
nothing to complain about
or to criticise.  Rather
hard on a young fellow
not unduly given to speech-making.
Tell you what,
<span class="sc">Toby</span>, if you've got three-quarters
of an hour to
spare, and will come with
me into the Lobby, I'll
read you my speech."</p>

<p>Much touched at this
kindness. Unfortunately
had an engagement which
prevented my availing
myself of it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kennaway</span> and Alphabet
<span class="sc">Coutts</span> in same box as
<span class="sc">Wyndham</span>; get out of it
in different fashion. They,
also, had prepared speeches,
unknowing what turn affairs
would take. Weren't
going to waste them, so
delivered them at length.
They had everything but
an audience. House could
not prevent them reeling
off their speeches, but
wouldn't stay to listen.
Everybody  happy  all
round, and evening agreeably
wasted.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;More talk round Address.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Pretty to see <span class="sc">Don't-Keir Hardie</span> just now escorted
into House arm-in-arm with <span class="sc">Charles Edward Howard Vincent,
C.B.</span>, formerly of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, now Colonel of the
Queen's Westminster Volunteers. Some talk of the two Members
temporarily changing coats whilst they addressed the House. This
was <span class="sc">Howard Vincent's</span> suggestion.</p>

<p>"I fancy, Brother <span class="sc">Hardie</span>," he said, "it would picturesquely
emphasise the situation, don't you know, if we thus made community
of at least our coats. That's rather a remarkable garment you wear.
If I put it on, and you wore mine, then House would see how
thoroughly one we are. Do you mind?"</p>

<p>"Well," said <span class="sc">Hardie</span>, dubiously, "there's a good many things
in the pockets, and they might get loose if you went mauling round
with the coat. So I think, if you don't mind, we'll go in our own
duds."</p>

<p>"Oh, as you please," said the Colonel, coldly, a little hurt at this
evidence of lack of confidence on part of his new pal.</p>

<p>So <span class="sc">Don't-Keir Hardie</span>, moving Amendment to Address, orated
in his own clothes, whilst <span class="sc">Howard Vincent</span> sat above Gangway
near him, and punctuated his speech with persistent cry of "Hear!
hear!" A notable figure his friend made. Evidently in the ranks
of the Unemployed in the <span class="sc">Don't-Keir Hardie</span> household are the
comb and brush. Through a mass of black hair, matted on head
and chin, <span class="sc">Don't-Keir</span> looked on House of Commons. The coat
<span class="sc">Howard Vincent</span> hankered after was rather a jacket, cut short, so
as to hide little of the effulgence of his murky mustard-hued
trowsers. Pockets alike of trowsers and jacket were bulging with
letters and papers. You could see when he stood up to speak that
he had just posted a letter to himself, sticking it in his waistcoat
pocket, which only half
concealed its surface.</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know
how it is," said <span class="sc">Gorst</span>,
curiously regarding <span class="sc">Don't-Keir
Hardie</span>, and his
eruption of correspondence,
"but our friend, for whom
I shall certainly vote,
somehow reminds me of
<i>Mrs. Jellaby</i>. The same
earnestness of vague purpose,
the same self-devotion
to public questions,
and the same large correspondence.
I wouldn't be
surprised, if you had the
opportunity of examining
our friend's hands, if you
found them rather inked
than horny. Still, I shall
vote for him, and say
something, if not exactly
in his favour, at least a
few words that will puzzle
our fellows and rile the
Bench opposite."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Don't-Keir
Hardie</span> moved
Amendment to Address,
calling upon Parliament to
provide for Unemployed;
negatived by 276 votes
against 109.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;"It was a
good thing to win the Inverness
Burghs," said the
<span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> just
now, reflectively stroking
his chin. "But it was not
all gain. <span class="sc">Finlay</span> worth a
good deal to us. In moments
of profoundest depression
he acted upon Mr.
G. with remarkable tonic
effect. Often when we sat
on other side, things going
bad, and Mr. G. has seemed
a little dull, he has accidentally
turned round, and
caught sight of <span class="sc">Finlay</span>,
sitting, as you will remember
he did, just behind us.
In a moment our revered
Chief was another man.
His eye flashed, colour came
back to his face, every nerve vibrated: Mr. G. was himself again.
On the whole, I fancy <span class="sc">Finlay</span> was worth more to us than the two
votes on a Division, for which we have bartered him."</p>

<p>Much in what the <span class="sc">Squire</span> says. It turned out this afternoon he
did not mourn as one who has no hope, <span class="sc">Finlay</span> gone, but <span class="sc">Jesse
Collings</span> remains. Has in degree, the same physical and mental effect
on Mr. G. that <span class="sc">Finlay</span> had. This afternoon Mr. G. sitting on Treasury
Bench, apparently waiting for Division. Debate on <span class="sc">Jesse Collings's</span>
Amendment to Address flickering out. <span class="sc">Henry Fowler</span>, in vigorous
speech, had replied for Government. <span class="sc">Edward Stanhope</span> said a few
words; nothing to be done but to take Division. Whilst <span class="sc">Stanhope</span>
speaking, Mr. G. turned round to see how forces were mustered.
Accidentally his eye fell on benevolent visage of <span class="sc">Jesse Collings</span>,
just then lit up with smile of genial satisfaction at compliment paid
him by personal reference in <span class="sc">Stanhope's</span> speech. In an instant
Mr. G.'s visage and attitude altered. The spell had worked, and
to surprise of House he followed <span class="sc">Stanhope</span>, falling straightway
upon the unsuspecting <span class="sc">Jesse</span>, treating him, as <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, an amused and interested spectator of the scene, observed, "with all
the vigorous familiarity Pantaloon is accustomed to meet with at
Christmastide."</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>, 2 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>&mdash;Long time since I saw Liberals in such fighting
trim as at this moment. Been at it all night discussing <span class="sc">Redmond's</span>
motion for release of Dynamitards. <span class="sc">Asquith</span> made speech that has
confirmed and improved his Parliamentary position. At quarter to
one this morning Division taken, giving thumping majority, 316, to
Government. When figures announced, Ulster Member moved
Adjournment of Debate. Wants to talk about release of Gweedore
prisoners.</p>

<p>"Right you are," said <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>; "Twelve o'Clock Rule
suspended; we can sit all night. Fire away!"</p>

<p>Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, forgetful of many cheerful nights he has sat up
hearing the chimes in company with <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span>, protested
against this as tyrannical proceeding. Irish Members massed below
Gangway howled with delight. Their turn come now. Long they
groaned under Prince <span class="sc">Arthur's</span> iron heel. Now they've got <i>him</i>
down, and dance round him with shouts of exultation and Homeric
bursts of laughter. Hardly can his voice be heard above the din;
but he pegs along, finally turning his back on jubilant mob below
Gangway; addresses himself to <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, edging in a sentence amid
comparative pauses in uproar. <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> protests he will not
yield to force; Liberals opposite, cheered by news from Walsall,
following fast on heels of triumph at Halifax, laugh and scoff. Mr.
G. safely packed off to bed; the <span class="sc">Squire</span> and his brother officers on
Front Bench evidently ready to make a night of it. <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span>,
radiant with this rare and rosy reflection of the good old times,
observes it is "an excellent hour of the evening to begin fresh work."</p>

<p>More hubbub; House divides, showing Government in possession
of majority of 80. Renewed tumult when they come back from the
Lobby. <span class="sc">Jesse Collings</span> rising, with intent to implore House to
remember its dignity, is met with such swift, sudden, rampant roar
of "Rat! Rat!" that after ineffectual contest, he subsides. Another
Division; Government majority gone up one. Fresh Motion made
for Adjournment; Members tightening their belts for all-night
sitting, when <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> unexpectedly gives in. "Go on!
go on!" excited Liberals cry.</p>

<p>"No," said the dignified Old Roman, throwing an imaginary toga
over substantial shoulder. "No? they have done enough to make
their position clear before the country. Let them go to bed." So
at 2:20 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> they went.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Blowing great guns.</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;A flash in the pan at the opening of the Sitting,
when <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, meaning to smite at the unoffending figure
of the <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>, hit Mr. G. He explained, and
apologised; thereafter, a long, dull night.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Davitt</span> took his seat, amid loud cheers from both sides. A curious
episode in his history, honourable both to him and House. A real
good man <span class="sc">Davitt</span>, with all the modesty of sterling merit. Still,
inclined to be argumentative. Had scarcely taken his seat, when he
came up to me, and said, "It's very well for you, <i>Toby</i>, to be M.P.
for Barks; but I'm M.P. for Tenpence. Yes, that's the precise
sum it cost me to win my seat."</p>

<p>New Members come, and old ones depart. Everybody sorry to
hear of the death of <span class="sc">Louis Jennings</span>, a fine-natured, high-souled
man, of brilliant intellect and wide culture. In later Sessions has
been handicapped by the cruel illness that carried him off whilst in

<h2>THE LEGAL INFANT'S GUIDE TO KNOWLEDGE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Concerning the Stock Exchange.</span></p>

<p><i>Question.</i> What is the Stock Exchange?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> The best English substitute for Monte Carlo.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Has it any rivals?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly; the Turf and the Card-room.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> In your opinion, is the Stock Exchange preferable to the
alternatives you have mentioned?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It is, as it is more business-like, and consequently more
respectable.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Has politics anything to do with speculation at Capel Court?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To a certain extent; but a good unscrupulous untruth is better
than the tottering of kingdoms.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is the dissemination of false news permissible?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Only by operators for the rise or fall.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is a flutter?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The performance of a financial operation with the assistance of
a tossed-up halfpenny.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> When is it advisable to indulge in a flutter?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> At the moment when your credit is greater than your balance
at the Banker's.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is a balance?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> An unknown quantity&mdash;to the impecunious.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is it necessary for the impecunious to suffer want?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not if the lack of funds is concealed from the tradespeople.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Ought not a (legal) infant to pay his debts?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Only at the instigation of a County-Court Judge, or if they
happen to be debts of honour.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is a debt of honour?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Usually the outcome of a discreditable transaction.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is the nonpayment of a tradesman dishonourable?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, for such a payment is not a "necessary." Payment only
becomes a "necessary" when you bet with a man of your own order.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is it possible to do without money?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, when you can live upon your acquaintances.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> From your last answers it would appear that money seems
sometimes capable of being treated with levity. Can you give me
an instance when cash is not a light subject?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes when it is under weight, and is, consequently, refused at
your Banker's.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the best method of obtaining the full value of a light
sovereign?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> By obtaining in return for it change in silver from a friend.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is silver of the same value as gold?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, silver is a token; and in the instance to which I have
referred, it would be a token of confidence.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Would this transaction be amusing?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, to everyone but the friend.</p>
